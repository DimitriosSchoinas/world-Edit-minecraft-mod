# User story
As a player I want a way to apply visual weather effects, such as rain, snow, and drought, to specific areas of the building so that it is easier to change the aspect of my buildings depending on the weather. 

**Note**
These effects would simulate the impact of weather on the blocks, altering their appearance to reflect wet, frozen or weathered conditions so that I can create a visually immersive experience.
