Pattern 1 - Dimitrios Schoinas 65313 - I think that the class is well identified even though you could show a better method as an example

Pattern 2 - João Rivera 62877 - Looks like an iterator pattern and seems to me that the class diagram is also well done.

Patter 3 - Gonçalo Cascais 60046 - Singleton well identified
