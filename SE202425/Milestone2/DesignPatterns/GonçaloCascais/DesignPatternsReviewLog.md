Pattern 1 - João Rivera 62877 - Everyithing looks good on this one.

Pattern 2 - João Nasicmento 62896 - Is a good identification of the pattern. Explains the necessity of it well. Good work!

Pattern 3 - Dimitrios Schoinas - I think it is well explained since the class has just 1 entry and 1 access point to that instance
