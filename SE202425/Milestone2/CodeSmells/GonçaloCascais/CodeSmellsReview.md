Review Code Smells 1: João Rivera 62877 - Looks good to me, the suggestion for the refactoring also seems correct and how I would do it.

Review Code Smell 2: Diogo Mateus 65379 - I agree with the found problem. The implementation of that Class should solve the issue in question.
Good work.

Review Code Smell 3: João Nascimento 62896 - Agreed, it is a too long method impacting the understanding of the code, good job identifying it!
