Review code smell 1:
Jo√£o Rivera 62877 - Looks good only shares the same problem I had with the other code smell I reviewed that is the refactoring is hard to find as it is in the middle of the explanation of how you found the code smell.

Review code smell 2: Dimitrios Schoinas 65313 - This code smell seems well identified since there is not any code inside it , which means that this method is a good example for speculative generality code smell since it doesn't add any behavior and adds unnecessary complexity to the code.

Review code smell 3: Diogo Mateus 65379 - Looks all good to me. Well identified and for sure a Long Method code smell.
