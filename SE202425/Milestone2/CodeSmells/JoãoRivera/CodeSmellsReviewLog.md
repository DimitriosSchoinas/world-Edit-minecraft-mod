Review Code Smell 1: Diogo Mateus 65379 - More examples than needed which helps identify and visualize the problems better, good work.
You also divided the main points well. The only thing to note is that in the Code Snippet, it would be easier if you showed in 
which line the method was located, as it would make it easier to find in the Class.

Reveiew Code Smell 2: Dimitrios  Schoinas 65313 -I think that overall you selected a good code smell since I can easily see a better implementation as you said.

Reveiew Code Smell 3: Gon√ßalo Cascais 60046 - I completely agree with your suggestion to create an object for the parameters instead of passing multiple individual parameters. This approach will definitely enhance the clarity and maintainability of our code.
